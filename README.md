# nbatanking
This is an attempt to make an nba gm game where you try to tank your way to drafting 3 stars (the traditional number of stars needed to make a championship team).  I liked playing the one made by The Ringer (https://www.theringer.com/2017/1/24/16036704/tanking-the-game-5f5524ec589d), but it is no longer playable, so I'm trying to re-make it.
